# Charter React Challenge - Participant Notes:

I made the following assumptions prior to starting this challenge:

- That I should keep the time taken around 2 hours max
- That I should attempt to maintain the use of the already selected libraries and patterns

Though I had briefly used graphql before, I had never used Apollo prior to this. I did not find it intuitive. Even after reading their docs, I still could not get sort and search working without using their reducers, which their own docs said not to use. As a result I got less done than I had hoped. I will try and learn more about Apollo and I am interested in knowing how to work it into a more complex app where data from multiple apis needs to interact.

I like your choice of exercise and the freedom you gave, though it did not allow me to show one thing I am good at, which is following requirements. If I had the time I would have liked to add search, a second toggleable row per repo with more data and some tests. I am not good with design so any additional styling would be a waste for me. I can copy any comp to the pixel but I don't have the creativity come up with unique styles.
